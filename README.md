# Kialo Debates

This repo contains / will contain the relevant code behind the following academic publications (in chronological order) concerning the analysis of online debates from the perspectives of, e.g. complex networks, argumentation theory and natural language processing. We begin with debates from [Kialo](https://www.kialo.com/), as its moderation policies result in a relatively clean dataset.
